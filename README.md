# Booking Website for Little Lemon

## Overview of the Project
This project was made while taking the Coursera Front-End Development course offered by Meta. This website served as the Front-End Development Track's culmuniation.

This website demonstrated the Little Lemon Website's implementation of a booking application. This was made using React Components to demonstrate how to use React to develop a website. Using API calls is another element of this.

Please be aware that aside from the design, this website only has the Reserve a Table feature operational.
